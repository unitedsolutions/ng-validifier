# ng-validifier

Validation of user inputs is a critical requirement for all data-driven
applications.  Despite the necessity for data assurance, the latter is almost
always a supporting functionality and never the centerpiece of a software.
Mixing program's foundational code with poorly configurable and poorly 
portable validation instructions unnecessarily complicates the application and 
undermines its viability.  

`ng-validifier` was written to reduce the non-central code base by giving a 
developer a toolset to completely excise data assurance instructions from a 
constructed program.  The framework accomplishes this by simplifying, 
standardizing, and enhancing angular's validation features and by providing an 
application programming interface (API) to define a precise visual communication 
of a validation state.  Outsourcing input checking to ng-validify is likely to 
result in a leaner code that is more aligned with a software's purpose and 
identity.
